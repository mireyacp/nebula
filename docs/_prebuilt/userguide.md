# **User Guide**

In this section, we will explain how to use the NEBULA Platform

## **Running NEBULA**
![Scenario configuration](static/userguide/running_nebula.png) 

To run NEBULA, you can use the following command line:

<pre><code><span style="color: grey;">(nebula-dfl)</span><span style="color: blue;">user@host</span>:~$ <span style="color: green;">python app/main.py [PARAMS]</span></code></pre>

The first time you run the platform, the nebula-frontend docker image
will be built. This process can take a few minutes.

You can show the PARAMS using:

<pre><code><span style="color: grey;">(nebula-dfl)</span><span style="color: blue;">user@host</span>:~$ <span style="color: green;">python app/main.py --help</span></code></pre> 

The frontend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:6060 (by default) if the port is available

To change the default port of the frontend, you can use the following
command line:

<pre><code><span style="color: grey;">(nebula-dfl)</span><span style="color: blue;">user@host</span>:~$ <span style="color: green;">python app/main.py --webport [PORT]</span></code></pre> 

To change the default port of the statistics endpoint, you can use the
following command line:

<pre><code><span style="color: grey;">(nebula-dfl)</span><span style="color: blue;">user@host</span>:~$ <span style="color: green;">python app/main.py --statsport [PORT]</span></code></pre>
