        This method sets up both console and file logging with a consistent format and appropriate log levels. 
        It also ensures that Uvicorn loggers are properly configured to avoid duplicate log outputs.

        Main functionalities:
            - Defines a custom log format.
            - Sets up a stream (console) handler with INFO level.
            - Applies a terminal-specific formatter for better readability.
            - Resets and disables propagation on Uvicorn-related loggers.

        Typical use cases:
            - Enables real-time monitoring of controller events in the console.
            - Ensures clean and consistent logging output during deployment.

        Note:
            This method does not set up file logging directly, but prepares the base configuration 
            and Uvicorn logger behavior for further logging use.
